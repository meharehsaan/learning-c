# learning-c

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

It is a very popular language, despite being old.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system, databases, compilers and so on.

### Datatypes

---

In C programming, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. C has several built-in data types, which can be broadly categorized into the following categories

#### Basic Datatypes

- **int** Used to store integers, such as whole numbers.
- **char** Used to store single characters or small integers (ASCII values).
- **float** Used to store single-precision floating-point numbers.
- **double** Used to store double-precision floating-point numbers.

#### Enumerated Data Type

- **Enum** Used to define a custom data type consisting of a set of named **constants** called enumerators.
  
#### Derived Data Types

- **array** A collection of elements of the **same** data type.
- **pointer** A variable that stores the memory address of another **variable**.
- **structure** A user-defined data type that groups **multiple** variables of different data types under one name.
  
#### Void Data Type

- **void** Represents the absence of a type or an empty return type in functions.
  
Each data type has a specific range of values it can hold, and the size of the data types can vary based on the system's architecture (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit).
